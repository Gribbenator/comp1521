The execve function aims to replace the current process with a process executing the specified program. Ideally, the execve function never returns. However, it has a return type of int.

    a. Under what circumstances does execve return a value?


    b. What should the calling program do if execve does return?


    c. Write two small programs to work out whether execve causes a new process ID to be created, or whether it inherits the caller's process ID.
See: `exec.c` and `pid.c`
