The kill command (run from the shell command-line) and the kill() system call can be used to send any of the defined signals to a specified process. For each of the following signals, explain the circumstances under which it might be generated (apart from kill), and what is the default effect on the process receiving the signal:

Hint: `man 7 signal`

A signal handler is the function that is called when it receives a message.
