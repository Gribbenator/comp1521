Under what circumstances might a call to fork fail?

Hint: resource limits

`fork` returns -1 when it fails.

- The OS does not have enough memory.
- The OS reaches the maximum number of processes.
- The user reaches their maximum number of processes.

// fork bomb
int main()
{
    while(1) 
       fork();
    return 0;
}
