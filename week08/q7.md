Under what circumstances might a call to fork fail?

Hint: resource limits

fork returns -1 when it fails

- not enough memory
- OS has max number of processes
OS has an array of processes
- process id is just an index in this array

- set a per-user limit of processes

// fork bomb
int main()
{
    while(1) 
       fork();
    return 0;
}
