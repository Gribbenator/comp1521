The `sigaction` function for defining signal handlers takes three arguments:

    - `int signum`
The signal whose handler is being defined

    - `struct sigaction *act`
Pointer to a record describing how to handle the signal

    - `struct sigaction *oldact`
Pointer to a record describing how the signal was handled (set by sigaction if not NULL)

The `struct sigaction` record includes a field of type `void (*sa_handler)(int)`.

Describe precisely what this field is, and what its type signature means.
