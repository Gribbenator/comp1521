Some commands on Unix allow you to name the files that they operate on, e.g.,
```
cat file
```
Commands that read from their standard input allow you to specify which file they read their input from by redirecting their standard input, e.g.,

```
cat < file
```

Describe how each of these cases might be implemented. Assume that once the file is made accessible, it is scanned and copied to the standard output (file descriptor 1, or the #define'd constant STDOUT_FILENO) as follows:

```c
int infd;               // input file descriptor
char buffer[BUFSIZ];    // input file buffer
int nread;              // # characters read

while ((nread = read (infd, buffer, BUFSIZ)) > 0)
    write (STDOUT_FILENO, buffer, nread);
```
