The Unix/Linux shell is a text-oriented program that runs other programs. It behaves more-or-less as follows:

```
print a prompt
while (read another command line) {
    break the command line into an array of words (args[])
    // args[0] is the name of the command, a[1],... are the command-line args
    if (args[0] starts with '.' or '/')
        check whether args[0] is executable
    else
        search the command PATH for an executable file called args[0]
    if (no executable called args[0])
        print "Command not found"
    else
        execute the command
    print a prompt
}
```

    a. How can you find what directories are in the PATH?
Hint: What is `PATH`?
Hint: `man 1 env`

    b. Describe the search the command PATH process in more detail. What the kinds of system calls would be needed to determine whether there was an executable file in one of the path directories?
Hint: `man 2 stat`
