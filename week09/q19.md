Consider a file of size 10000 bytes, open for reading on file descriptor fd, initially positioned at the start of the file (offset 0). What will be the file position after each of these calls to lseek()? Assume that they are executed in sequence, and one will change the file state that the next one deals with.

read(1000 bytes); file offset -> advance 1000 bytes
read(1000 bytes); file offset -> advance 1000 bytes

offset is signed.
whence:
 - SEEK_SET - start of file
 - SEEK_CUR - current offset
 - SEEK_END - end of file

a. lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END);
- moves offset to end of file.

b. lseek(fd, -1000, SEEK_CUR);
- moves offset 1000 bytes backwards from the current offset.


c. lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_SET);


d. lseek(fd, -100, SEEK_SET);
- does nothing
- no error

e. lseek(fd, 1000, SEEK_SET);
- moves offset 1000 bytes from the start of file.


f. lseek(fd, 1000, SEEK_CUR);


g. lseek(fd, 100, SEEK_END);
- moves offset 100 bytes from the end of file.


Create a large empty file
write(1 byte);
lseek(1000000 bytes, SEEK_END);
write(1 byte);
