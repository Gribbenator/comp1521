The stat() and lstat() functions both take an argument which is a pointer to a struct stat object, and fill it with the meta-data for a named file.

On Linux, a struct stat contains the following fields (among others, which have omitted for simplicity):

struct stat s;
stat("/usr/bin/cat", &s);
s.st_gid =

```c
struct stat {
    ino_t st_ino;         /* inode number */
    mode_t st_mode;       /* protection */
    uid_t st_uid;         /* user ID of owner */
    gid_t st_gid;         /* group ID of owner */
    off_t st_size;        /* total size, in bytes */
    blksize_t st_blksize; /* blocksize for filesystem I/O */
    blkcnt_t st_blocks;   /* number of 512B blocks allocated */
    time_t st_atime;      /* time of last access */
    time_t st_mtime;      /* time of last modification */
    time_t st_ctime;      /* time of last status change */
};
```

inode - id for your file, basically an array index somewhere
file name - just for humans
mode - rwxrw-r--
rwx - owner
rw- - group
r-- - everyone else

blksize_t st_blksize; /* blocksize for filesystem I/O */
blkcnt_t st_blocks;   /* number of 512B blocks allocated */

RAM - minimum size is 1 byte
Hard drive - 512 bytes or 4092 bytes
size == 700 bytes == 2x 512 bytes

Sparse file:
Hard drive only allocates blocks to parts of a file written to.
size == 1000000 bytes == 2x blocks
write 1 byte at offset 1 byte <- block here
write 1 byte at offset 1000000 bytes <- block here
Blocks between two writes are not allocated.

Explain what each of the fields represents (in more detail than given in the comment!) and give a typical value for a regular file which appears as follows:

```
$ ls -ls stat.c
8 -rw-r--r--  1 jas  cs1521  1855  Sep  9 14:24 stat.c
```

Assume that jas has user id 516, and the cs1521 group has group id 36820.
