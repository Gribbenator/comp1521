For each of the following calls to the fopen() library function, give an open() system call that has equivalent semantics relative to the state of the file.

a. fopen(FilePath, "r")


b. fopen(FilePath, "a")


c. fopen(FilePath, "w")


d. fopen(FilePath, "r+")


e. fopen(FilePath, "w+")


Obviously, fopen() returns a FILE*, and open() returns an integer file descriptor. Ignore this for the purposes of the question; focus on the state of the open file.
